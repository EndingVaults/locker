2) Once they open it, redirect them to "Elements" and tell them to copy the blue HTML which looks like this
  "<html> / <html data-btr-loaded" on top of the actual element page, tell them to paste it in your chat

3) Open the "message.txt" they sent you, their auth key is in there. Before doing anything press "Format" and press Word Wrap.
 Once done, press CTRL+F and search for "+gameinfo" that's their auth key.
