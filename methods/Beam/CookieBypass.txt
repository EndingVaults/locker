Since roblox patched the cookie method with 1 ip = 1 cookie, here is a somewhat working work-around to it

1. Get a VPN with as many locations as possible, preferably private internet access or expressvpn
2. Lookup the person's IP and connect your VPN to a location near it
3. Try logging in with the cookie, 50% of the time it will work
